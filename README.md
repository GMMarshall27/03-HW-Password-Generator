# 03-HW-Password-Generator
Description:

For this assignment I modified the starter code to add functionality to it using JavaScript. I was able to do this by creating variables, arrays, if/else if/ else statments as well as adding prompt, confirm, and alert windows. By doing this I was then able to run a for loop to randomly generate a password based on the criteria that the user selects.
